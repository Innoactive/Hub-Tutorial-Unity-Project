# Innoactive Hub SDK Unity Tutorial

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to start developing with the _Innoactive Hub Unity SDK_. 

You will learn how to setup your Unity project with the _Innoactive Hub_ and create Unity scenes, populate them with interactable objects and your own tools and how to persist them. Furthermore, we cover multiplayer capabilities, our extendable XML menu as well as the context menu and many more features.

The tutorial is split into chapters, where every chapter builds upon the previous ones. We do not want you to just read code but learn how to use the _Hub_ by implementing yourself. Therefore, we provide stub code in every chapter and an explanation on what to do. Just checkout the branch of your next chapter and follow the instructions. Every chapter also has a "completed"-branch which is our suggested solution. So if you struggle just checkout the completed branch and go on from there. The completed state is also the basis for the next chapter.

The tutorial is currently based on version **3.3.2**, but will be kept up to date in the future - and also works for previous versions.

# Overview

The _Innoactive Hub Unity SDK_ is based on [VRTK](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK) to provide an easy entry point into Virtual Reality interactions as well as development for multiple Head Mounted Displays (HMD). 

Additionally, Photon as a proven network technology is used to guarantee stable multi user experience.

# What you need to start

Simply clone this repository and get your own _Innoactive Hub Unity SDK_ and access to the _Innoactive Hub Backend_ (optional but recommended).

## <a name="Chapter1"></a>**Chapter 1** Setup Unity project

_branch: Chapter_1/Setup_Unity_Project_

After opening the Unity project you will find some folders like Materials, Models, Prefabs etc. in your project structure. You can ignore these for now.

### Importing Innoactive Hub SDK

To start setting up your project, download your version of the _Innoactive Hub Unity SDK_ from http://docs.hub.innoactive.de/. Import the unitypackage by dragging it into your Unity project and wait till it is imported. _Reminder:_ In this tutorial we use version 3.3.2.

The Hub SDK will be imported into _Assets/Extensions_ which is also what we recommend. An error will pop-up which can be ignored for now.

### Importing Steam VR

Download and import _Steam VR_ version 1.2.3 from https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/1.2.3. We recommend moving the Steam VR folder into _Assets/Extensions_, right next to the Hub SDK.

__Important__: Steam VR version 2 which is available on the Asset Store is not supported by VRTK 3.3.0 as currently used in the _Innoactive Hub SDK_.

After the Hub SDK as well as Steam VR is imported we take care of the following error (if it is shown):

```Assets/Extensions/hub-sdk/SDK/Utils/UnityDotNetCheck/UnityDotNetCheck.cs(6,0): error CS1029: #error: 'This Unity project is configured for .Net 2.0 subset, but the Innoactive Hub SDK requires full .Net functionality. Please go to "PlayerSettings > Other Settings" and change Api Compatibility Level to .Net 2.0'```

Simply do what it says and go to the Unity PlayerSettings and change the Api Compatibility Level in Other Settings from _.Net 2.0 Subset_ to _.Net 2.0_.

### Hub SDK Wizard

To make your life easier we included the _Hub SDK Setup Wizard_ which helps you to setup your project. You can find it by clicking on ```Innoactive > Hub > Setup Wizard```. The Wizard will pop-up and show you a list of settings with errors and warnings. We can ignore most of them for now (especially because they are automatically created for you) but want to explain some important ones.

The _Hub Settings_ are your central point for general settings within your application. You can set specific build settings, colors to customize your experience, standard menu actions etc. Most of this will be covered in later chapters.

The _Hub Client Credentials_ are your personal credentials to access the backend which you get from your Innoactive contact person. It is recommended to use the wizard to populate these values but also possible to alter/include the client-config.json file in _Hub-Tutorial-Unity-Project/Config_.

As mentioned before Multi User is based on _Photon_. To configure your multi user settings we use another config file for this which you can also find in _Hub-Tutorial-Unity-Project/Config_ (after you clicked on save in the SDK Wizard). For now multi user is turned off but will be explained in Chapter 11.

So for now you can just enter your _Hub Client Credentials_ and click on save on the bottom of the _Hub SDK Wizard_. The rest is handled for you for now.
