# Innoactive Hub SDK Unity Tutorial

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to start developing with the _Innoactive Hub Unity SDK_. 

You will learn how to setup your Unity project with the _Innoactive Hub_ and create Unity scenes, populate them with interactable objects and your own tools and how to persist them. Furthermore, we cover multiplayer capabilities, our extendable XML menu as well as the context menu and many more features.

The tutorial is split into chapters, where every chapter builds upon the previous ones. We do not want you to just read code but learn how to use the _Hub_ by implementing yourself. Therefore, we provide stub code in every chapter and an explanation on what to do. Just checkout the branch of your next chapter and follow the instructions. Every chapter also has a "completed"-branch which is our suggested solution. So if you struggle just checkout the completed branch and go on from there. The completed state is also the basis for the next chapter.

The tutorial is currently based on version **3.3.2**, but will be kept up to date in the future - and also works for previous versions.

# Overview

The _Innoactive Hub Unity SDK_ is based on [VRTK](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK) to provide an easy entry point into Virtual Reality interactions as well as development for multiple Head Mounted Displays (HMD). 

Additionally, Photon as a proven network technology is used to guarantee stable multi user experience.

# What you need to start

Simply clone this repository and get your own _Innoactive Hub Unity SDK_ and access to the _Innoactive Hub Backend_ (optional but recommended).
